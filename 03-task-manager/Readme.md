# Task-Manager Full-stack app

## About

- This contains a full-stack project whereby the frontend has been provided already but i am responsible for creating and connecting the backend to the cloud so that it sunctions every where

The REST in "REST API" means: Representaional State Transfer

to install mongoose "npm i mongoose"

why do we need the dotenv file ?

"if you think about it when u push ur backend code to github without it any one who has the repo can tamper with your code but u still need that code on github so ur app works. So basically the dotenv file is used to keep our application secrets

so to use the dotenv set up u have to install a package called "dotenv/.env" which can be done by simply typing "npm i dotenv"

the schema helps prvide a structure to your documents
